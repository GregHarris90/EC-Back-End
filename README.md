# Technology-Used

- To build this project I used Sequelize and mySQL to build and connect a database to the provided code for this E-Commerce application. Once the routes were set up and the database was seeded with relevant information I then used Insomnia to ensure that everything was working and properly running. 

# User-Story

- With this application the user is able to GET products and their information from a connected database, and then POST new ones, PUT or update, and DELETE them. Below is a basic demonstration of this functionality!

# Conclusion

- Overall this project was much more straight forward than the last one. I think it was partially due to the fact I started with provided code and that Sequelize made using a database much easier to understand and implement. I am turning in this project late, but wanted to make sure to get everything working so I could get a good grade. Thank you!
